  abstract = {Artwork page for ‘144 Magnesium Square’, Carl Andre, 1969 Andre's metal floor sculptures are intended to be walked on. This example is one of a series made between 1967 and 1975, each using a different metal. The 12-inch magnesium squares are arranged into 12 rows of 12, to create a larger square with a total of 144 units. Moving over the square brings an awareness of the texture of the magnesium plates. Andre accepted that the surface of the work would be altered by visitors' footsteps, observing that it 'becomes its own record of everything that's happened to it'.},

It's this new life that keeps him a key figure in techno today. In his 2014 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Hood passionately discussed his work with Underground Resistance, his Floorplan alias, the importance of hi-hats, and much more.},

  edition = {2nd ed. rev.},
  publisher = {{Wayne State University Press}},
  location = {{Detroit}},
  abstract = {When it was originally published in 1999, Techno rebels became the definitive text on a hard-to-define but vital genre of music. The author demystified techno’s characteristics, influences, and origins and argued that although techno enjoyed its most widespread popularity in Europe, its birthplace and most important incubator was Detroit. In this revised and updated edition, Sicko expands on Detroit’s role in the birth of techno and takes readers on an insider’s tour of techno’s past, present, and future in an account filled with firsthand anecdotes, interviews, and artist profiles. He begins by examining the underground 1980s party scene in Detroit, where DJs and producers like the Electrifying Mojo, Ken Collier, The Wizard, and Richard Davis were experimenting with music that was a world apart from anything happening in New York or Los Angeles. He details the early days of the "Belleville Three"—Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson—who created the Detroit techno sound and became famous abroad as the sound spread to the UK and Europe. In this revised edition, he delves deeper into the Detroit story, detailing the evolution of the artists and scene into the mid-1990s, and looks to nearby Ann Arbor to consider topics like the Electrifying Mojo’s beginnings, the role of radio station WCBN, and the emergence of record label Ghostly International. Sicko concludes by investigating how Detroit techno functions today after the contrived electronica boom of the late 1990s, through the original artists, new sounds, and Detroit’s annual electronic music festival. Ultimately, it is argued that techno is rooted in the "collective dreaming" of the city of Detroit—as if its originators wanted to preserve what was great about the city—its machines and its deep soul roots. The first edition is abstracted as RILM [ref]1999-61126[/ref].},
